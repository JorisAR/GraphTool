# Graph Visualisation Tool

A simple React-based tool for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graphs. This project includes features for:
- Creating graphs by specifying nodes and links
- Visualizing graphs using p5.js
- Displaying and editing adjacency and Laplacian matrices
- Calculating global and local graph metrics

It is hosted at: https://jorisar.github.io/GraphTool/

## Features

- **Graph Input**: Enter nodes and links to create a graph.
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualize the graph using p5.js.
- **Adjacency Matrix**: View and edit the graph's adjacency matrix.
- **Laplacian Matrix**: View the graph's Laplacian matrix in LaTeX.
- **Global Metrics**: Calculate and display metrics like node count, link count, clustering coefficient, and average degree.
- **Local Metrics**: Analyze metrics for individual nodes.
